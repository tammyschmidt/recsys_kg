## Dataset

This project uses the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), a public dataset provided by Yelp for academic and research purposes.

We specifically use the **business.json** file, which contains information about businesses such as:

- Business ID
- Name
- Location (city, state, latitude, longitude)
- Categories (e.g., Restaurant, Cafe)
- Star rating and review count
- Attributes (e.g., price range, delivery, parking)

⚠️ **Note**: Due to GitHub's file size limits, the dataset file (`yelp_academic_dataset_business.json`) is not included in this repository.  
Please download it directly from the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and place it in the following path:
backend/data/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

We focus on **restaurant businesses** only for our recommendation system.
